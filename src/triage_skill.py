"""Inbox Triage skill worker — STUB.

This is where you work. The signatures below are a suggested starting shape —
keep them, change them, or add to them as you see fit. Replace every
`raise NotImplementedError` with a real implementation.

You are free to choose how you classify emails (an LLM call is the obvious move —
that's the point of the role), how you structure the human-in-the-loop gate, and
how you wire the client. The requirements are in the README; how you interpret and
verify "done" is part of what we're looking at.
